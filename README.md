## Running 

To run the project:

* You just need to:
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

* Because I have a little change on the api-server:
    - When create new comment or post will generate a hash id
    - 
* so In another terminal window:
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

You can visit it on `http://localhost:3000`
